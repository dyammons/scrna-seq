# scrna-seq

This repository is designed to aid in the installation and running of single-cell RNA sequencing alignment protocols and to provide a starting point for advanced downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data.

## File structure:
- [:file\_folder: data-processing](/data-processing) contains instructions for data alignment using a standard `Cell Ranger` protocol and `kallisto` pseudo-alignment protocol. To be added is `Velocyto` a toolkit that can be used for RNA velocity analysis.
- [:file\_folder: analysis](/analysis-code) contains the analysis code with some details regarding usage (NOTE: this section is very much still under development).

## Additional resources
Outside of this repository, we also have a repository called, [scrna-scripts]( https://github.com/dyammons/scrna-scripts) which contains all the scripts and information for running preliminary analysis on a `Cell Ranger` aligned dataset. (NOTE: Still underdevelopment â€“ expected to be finalized the week of 11/27/2023)
